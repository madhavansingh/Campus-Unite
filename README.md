## 🚀 Project Overview

Campus Unite is a unified digital ecosystem for educational institutions.  
It eliminates communication barriers between students, event organizers, and administrative authorities by offering a centralized platform where everyone stays informed and connected.

The goal is simple — make campus interaction **faster, smarter, and transparent** through technology.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In most campuses, communication between students and administration remains outdated and inefficient:
- Students miss event notifications or have no proper channel to raise concerns.  
- Organizers struggle with reaching the right audience for campus activities.  
- Authorities receive scattered complaints with no real-time tracking or prioritization.

**Campus Unite** addresses all these pain points by providing a single web interface where every user has a clear, role-based experience.
