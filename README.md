## 🎯 Problem Statement

In most campuses, communication between students and administration remains outdated and inefficient:
- Students miss event notifications or have no proper channel to raise concerns.  
- Organizers struggle with reaching the right audience for campus activities.  
- Authorities receive scattered complaints with no real-time tracking or prioritization.

**Campus Unite** addresses all these pain points by providing a single web interface where every user has a clear, role-based experience.
